# design-principles-and-methods-project

This was the final project submission for the McGill University Course `ECSE-211` Design Principles and Methods.

The course is notoriously time consuming for students and I wanted to keep this in GitHub to remember how painful it was. You can try to read through code but it is university level and therefore unreadable and likely not commented well.
